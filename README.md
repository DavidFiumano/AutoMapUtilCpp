AutoMap Util for FRC

  You may do with this code as you please, within the confines of the included license. If you have any
  questions/concerns/comments, etc, send me a message on git or email me at Mynameisspam1@gmail.com (this is indeed 
  my legitimate email, not a spam email, despite the name) and I will respond promptly.
